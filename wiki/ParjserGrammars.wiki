#summary This page describes the format of parjser grammars.

= Introduction =

The parjser project does not provide parsers for a particular grammar: rather, it offers generic parsers which can parse text according to a specific grammar. The grammar is passed to the parser's constructor, and the parser can then use the grammar to discover a structure in the input text according to the syntax rules defined in the grammar.

This page provides some background on grammars in general, and provides detailed information about how to create a parjser grammar.
