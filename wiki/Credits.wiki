= Introduction =

While parjser does not depend directly on any third-party libraries, it is built using a number of external tools and utilities. In addition the Parjser Playground sample page depends on third-party libraries.

This page lists tools, utilities and libraries which are or were used at some point in producting and/or deploying parjser. 

== Google Closure Compiler ==
Parjser uses the [http://code.google.com/closure/ google closure compiler] to compress and optimize its javascript libraries.

== Make ==
Parjser uses and old school GNU makefile to control the build process with [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ GNU Make].

== JSLINT ==
[http://www.jslint.com/ JSLINT], the JavaScript Code Quality Tool by Douglas Crockford is used in the Parjsers Playground sample webpage to provide sensible error messages for user supplied grammars. 

== Geany and Gedit ==
Parjser is coded using the text editors Geany and Gedit.

== Browsers ==
Parjser is debugged using Mozilla Firefox and the Firebug plugin, and Google Chrome and its built-in developer tools.

== SQLite ==
The Sqlite grammar in parjser.grammars.sqlite was adapted from [http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html the official SQLite documentation]
