= Introduction =

While parjser does not depend directly on any third-party libraries, it is built using a number of external tools and utilities. In addition the Parjser Playground sample page depends on third-party libraries.

This page lists tools, utilities and libraries which are or were used at some point in producting and/or deploying parjser. 

= Google Closure Compiler =
Parjser uses the [http://code.google.com/closure/ google closure compiler] to compress and optimize its javascript libraries.
